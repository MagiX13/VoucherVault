## üí¨ Description

VoucherVault is a Django web application that allows you to manage coupons, vouchers, loyalty and gift cards digitally. It provides a web portal that is mobile friendly and easy to use. 

Additionally, it supports expiry notifications via Apprise URLs that will frequently remind you to redeem your stuff. You can also track fractional transactions, which help to understand historical redemptions and reflect the remaining monetary value of an item accurately.

Finally, redeem codes are nicely printed as QR code or EAN13 barcode.

## üê≥ Usage

````
# create volume dir for persistence
mkdir -p ./volume-data/database

# adjust permissions
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data volume-dir/*

# spawn the container stack
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
````

Once the container is up and running, you can access the web portal at http://127.0.0.1:8000. 

The default username is `admin`. The default password is auto-generated.

You can obtain the auto-generated password via the Docker container logs:

````
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f
````

> [!WARNING]
> The container runs as low-privileged `www-data` user. So you have to adjust the permissions for the persistent database bind mount volume. A command like `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data <path-to-volume-data-dir>` should work. Afterwards, please restart the container.

> [!TIP]
> This repository follows the Conventional Commits standard. Therefore, you will find `patch`, `minor` and `major` release version tags on DockerHub.
> No one stops you from using the `latest` image tag but I recommend pinning a minor version series tag such as `0.1.x`.
>
> This is safer for automatic upgrades and you still get recent patches as well as bug fixes.

## üåç Environment Variables

The docker container takes various environment variables:

| Variable                 | Description                                                                                                     | Default                    | Optional/Mandatory  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| `DOMAIN`                 | Your Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address. Used to define `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` for the Django framework. | `localhost` | Mandatory           |
| `SECURE_COOKIES`         | Set to `True` if you use a reverse proxy with TLS. Enables the `secure` cookie flag and `HSTS` HTTP response header, which will only work for SSL/TLS encrypted communication channels (HTTPS). | `False`                    | Optional            |
| `EXPIRY_THRESHOLD_DAYS`  | Defines the days prior item expiry when an Apprise expiry notification should be sent out.            | `30`                       | Optional            |
| `SECRET_KEY`             | Defines a fixed secret key for the Django framework. If missing, a secure secret is auto-generated on the server-side each time the container starts. | `<auto-generated>`     | Optional            |
| `PORT`                   | Defines a custom port. Used to set `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in conjunction with the `DOMAIN` environment variable for the Django framework. Only necessary, if VoucherVault is operated on a different port than `8000`, `80` or `443`. | `8000`                     | Optional            |
| `REDIS_HOST`             | Defines the Redis instance to use for Django-Celery-Beat task processing.                                       | `redis`                    | Optional            |

## üîî Notifications

Notifications are handled by [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise). 

You can define custom Apprise URLs in the user profile settings. The input form takes a single or a comma-separated list of multiple Apprise URLs.

The interval, how often items are checked against a potential expiry, is pre-defined (every Monday at 9AM) in the Django admin area. Here, we are utilizing Django-Celery-Beat + a Redis instance for periodic task execution. If you want to adjust the crontab interval, please head over to the admin area at `Periodic Tasks` > `Periodic Expiry Check` > `Crontab Schedule` > `Edit` and adjust to your liking.

An item will trigger an expiry notification if the expiry date is within the number of days defined by the environment variable `EXPIRY_THRESHOLD_DAYS`. By default, this threshold is set to 30 days.

## üîê Multi-User Setup

VoucherVault is initialized with a default superuser account named `admin` and a secure auto-generated password. 

This administrative account has full privileges to the Django admin panel, located at `/admin`. Therefore, all database model entries can be read and modified by this user. Additionally, new user accounts and groups can be freely created too.

For simplicity, VoucherVault makes use of the default Django authentication scheme for `Superusers` and `Staff Users`.

> [!CAUTION]
If you create new users on VoucherVault, you must at least assign the `Staff status` privilege. This indicates and ensures that the new user account can use the VoucherVault login area at `/admin`, although not being a superuser with high privileges.

## üíæ Backups

All application data is stored within an SQLite3 database. The database is persistently stored within a Docker bind mount volume, which is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The default location is defined as `./volume-data/database/db.sqlite3`.

Therefore, by backing up this bind mount volume, all your application data is saved.

> [!WARNING]
> Read the official [SQLite3 documentation](https://sqlite.org/backup.html) regarding backups.

### Manual Django Backups

You can alternatively dump the SQLite database content manually using Django's `manage.py`. This may help if something bricks and you have to re-import your application data into a freshly spawned VoucherVault container.

Proceed as follows:

#### Export data | Create Backup
````
# exec into the vouchervault container
docker exec -it vouchervault bash

# export sqlite3 database tables into outfile
python manage.py dumpdata auth.group > database/backup_db_table_groups.json
python manage.py dumpdata auth.user > database/backup_db_table_users.json
python manage.py dumpdata myapp.item > database/backup_db_table_items.json
python manage.py dumpdata myapp.transaction > database/backup_db_table_transactions.json
````

#### Import data | Recover Backup:
````
# import old backup outfiles into sqlite3
python manage.py loaddata database/backup_db_table_groups.json
python manage.py loaddata database/backup_db_table_users.json
python manage.py loaddata database/backup_db_table_items.json
python manage.py loaddata database/backup_db_table_transactions.json
````
